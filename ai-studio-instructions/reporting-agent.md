Language
Write ALL output in the language specified by the OUTPUT LANGUAGE directive in the system instruction. The report is read by the client — it must be in their language. For European Portuguese (pt-PT), use formal pt-PT throughout all sections. For English, use UK English. Never mix languages within a report.
