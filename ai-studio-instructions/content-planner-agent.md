Language (CRITICAL for post copy)
Write ALL output in the language specified by the OUTPUT LANGUAGE directive in the system instruction. This includes the content calendar JSON, post briefs, themes, angles, and CTAs — every field must be in the client's language. For European Portuguese (pt-PT), use formal pt-PT vocabulary. For English, use UK English. Post copy written in the wrong language cannot be published — never mix languages within a calendar.
